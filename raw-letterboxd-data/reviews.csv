also, not to spoil anything, but a character has a shift in the last act that feels a little out of place and just kind of... there? maybe unearned? i don't know; the scene where it happens also just feels a little oddly placed in the story.

2019-12-28,Zombie 3,1988,https://letterboxd.com/aghoulaghast/film/zombie-3/,3.5,,"this should been so much more of a mess, given it’s production history. it plays as a collection of zombie attack sequences without a lot of connective tissue. but it never really grinds to a halt in the last half the way some fragasso/mattei collaborations do. i mean, it’s still a mess, but it’s totally watchable.",blu-ray,2019-12-27

i read an interview with the safdies talk about someone saying the last 15 minutes are incredibly tense and they point out it’s really the last 45 minutes and it really is just like that.","theater, amc, digital, with-lauren",2019-12-27
2019-12-29,Humanoids from the Deep,1980,https://letterboxd.com/aghoulaghast/film/humanoids-from-the-deep/,3.5,,environmental creature feature that moves at a pretty decent clip. i’m super curious to know how this plays as originally intended – w/o the inserted nudity – though i did like the stinger ending.,"streaming, amazon prime",2019-12-28
2019-12-29,Ecco,1963,https://letterboxd.com/aghoulaghast/film/ecco/,3.5,,"pretty scattershot but also not nearly as cringe-y as i was expecting (well, until the last 20 minutes which include a woman castrating a reindeer with her teeth). some of these segments i would want watch to watch again.","blu-ray, something weird, mondo",2019-12-28
2019-12-29,The Forbidden,1966,https://letterboxd.com/aghoulaghast/film/the-forbidden/,3,,"i can’t really tell what was shot for this and what was taken from somewhere else; it’s like a weird collage of stripping, short film “re-enactments”, and sleeze.","blu-ray, something weird",2019-12-28
2019-12-29,The Notorious Bettie Page,2005,https://letterboxd.com/aghoulaghast/film/the-notorious-bettie-page/,3.5,,"a solid biopic with a good cast. there’s an interesting use of stock-footage as establishing shots during the black and white scenes that seemed like a novel approach.

how terrifying is that scene early on where she gets asked on a date and ends up surrounded by strange men? scariest thing i’ve seen in a while.","streaming, hbo",2019-12-28

- cameron mitchell is undercover as a russian-accented henchman before he’s revealed to be undercover cia and then he has a few rah-rah speeches
- oliver reed is drunk through most of his scenes. 
- the first half hour feels like a whole movie, so the rest kinda drags. but jeez is there a lot of gold sprinkled throughout. would love to watch this with a crowd.","streaming, amazon prime",2019-12-30
